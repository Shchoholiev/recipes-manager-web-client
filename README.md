6. **Using Visual Studio Code tasks**

- Build: `Ctrl + Shift + P` > `Tasks: Run Task` > `build`
- Publish: `Tasks: Run Task` > `publish`
- Watch and run: `Tasks: Run Task` > `watch`

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `appsettings.json` and environment-specific files (`appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.Production.json`).

Key settings you need to configure:

- **ApiUrl**: Base URL of the Recipes Manager API backend.

Example (`appsettings.Development.json`):

```json
{
  "ApiUrl": "https://sh-recipes-manager-api-dev.azurewebsites.net/",
  "ObjectStorageUrl": "https://recipes.l7l2.c16.e2-2.dev/"
}
```

- **ObjectStorageUrl**: URL to the storage where recipe images and assets are hosted.

### Environment Variables

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` â€” set to `Development` or `Production` to control environment.

### Authentication

- The app uses JWT tokens stored in HTTP cookies (`accessToken` and `refreshToken`) to authenticate API requests.
- Tokens are automatically refreshed if expired via the `AuthenticationService`.

Please ensure your backend API is properly configured to issue and accept tokens for smooth authentication.
